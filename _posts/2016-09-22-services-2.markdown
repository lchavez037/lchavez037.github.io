  Science and technology are my top interest. I enjoy spending time tending to 
  my garden and teaching myself programming. I focused alot of my time taking 
  courses in computer science learning to code. Recently I redesigned the
  <a href="http://maker.danforthcenter.org/" target="_blank"> Donald Danforth Plant Science Center Maker Group</a> web page and 
  regularly enjoy trying maker projects to practice working with electronics and coding in new languages.
